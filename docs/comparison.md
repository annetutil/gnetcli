### scrapligo

See [github.com/scrapli/scrapligo](https://github.com/scrapli/scrapligo).

- Uses `ssh` external binary to communicate with a device.
  It is less portable solution because it relies on external program, which may be absent or change its args.
- Lack of upload/download support.
- Do not have GRPC-server.

Scrapligo implements configuration mode and package for parsing of output.
