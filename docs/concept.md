## Concept

The idea of this project is to make lightweight abstraction upon network devices CLI. 
Main goals:
- Get rid of direct interaction with a device,
like executing commands, uploading and downloading files.
- Provide an interface as close as possible to the CLI on the device. Do 
not try to understand how the CLI works more than necessary to execute commands.
- Be flexible enough to be used on devices with crazy CLI-logic.
